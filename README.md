# Mapping Early American Elections

This repository contains the data in-progress from the *[Mapping Early American Elections](http://earlyamericanelections.org/)* project at the [Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media](http://rrchnm.org/). This project, which is funded by the Division of Preservation and Access at the National Endowment for the Humanities, is based on the data from the *[New Nation Votes](http://elections.lib.tufts.edu/)* project. 

## Status of the data

The data in this repository is currently in a pre-release state, and it may not yet be complete or checked for accuracy. When the data is released, it will be tagged in this repository and available for direct download on the [data page](http://earlyamericanelections.org/) of the project website. If you notice problems with the data, please open an issue.

## Repository structure
